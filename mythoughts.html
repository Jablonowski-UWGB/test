<body style="text-align:center;color:purple;font-family:courier;"><p> I learned html at an extremely basic level almost 20 years ago, and it is interesting to me how little and how much has changed. Each section of html can be dissected and checked for faults or rearranged to create an entirely different format on the page. This has been the concept that has not changed, but the vastness of situations and connections that html can be used for is new and exciting. For me personally, this was easier to comprehend with the reference guides because I had used html before and knew how to format a page using the codes provided.<br><p> Markdown was the hardest concept in this lesson because it was something I had never heard of before. Although it is meant to make things easier, I felt that I was learning how to subtract using addition. I kept trying to make it more difficult than it needed to be because it felt too simple, and I felt that more should be needed for a header than a #. Once I took time to investigate it, markdown made the process appear less messy on the page and was easier to read back when checking for errors. Also, I feel that less mistakes are possible with markdown because not as much detail is needed to communicate as with html.<br><p> Overall, this process was helpful in showing me how to build something out of nothing. With the information provided from <i>“Together We Write”</i> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"> W3 schools,</a> this whole process was pretty easy to navigate, and I really enjoyed getting back to the basics.</p>
